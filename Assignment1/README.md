# ‚ùÑÔ∏è European Snowfall Dynamics ‚Äî D3.js & Python Visualization

This project explores seasonal snowfall dynamics across 16 European countries over a 25-year period, using a dataset of monthly average snow depth `mean_SD`.

#### 1. Snow Dynamics per Country Over Time

This plot shows per-country snow variation over the years. Each peak reflects the most intense snow month recorded. Countries like Norway and Estonia demonstrate significant variance, while others like France rarely show snow.

#### 2. Bubble Ridge Plot: Monthly Variation by Year

This D3.js visualization illustrates how different countries contribute to snow depth month by month. Each year's row reveals the local winter rhythm. Combined with the following legend...

...we observe that Northern and Eastern European countries dominate high snow months in January and February.

#### 3. Spiral Monthly Evolution

![SD_Spiral_Dynamics](notebook/SD_Spiral_Dynamics.png)

We group December, January, and February snow depths by year and country into three radial spirals. This makes it easier to identify cyclical patterns ‚Äî for instance, 2010‚Äì2012 stands out for exceptionally high snowfall in February across several countries.

#### 4. üåä Seasonal Animation

Animated line graphs allow to see the seasonal snow ‚Äúwaves‚Äù across time, country by country. The opacity and flow reflect snow buildup and decay over the winter months.
